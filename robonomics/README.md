# Robonomics

## What we achieved

- Get a deeper understanding of the Robonomics
- Connect to a Robonomics Provider 3D Printer
- Able to access the 3D Printer
- Able to click manually the continue print button
- Identified important fields (start, progress, setRemark) for alpha version.

## Future Roadmap

As a team we really like the Idea of speaking with the Printer.  

The goal would be to write an Article.
The name would be `How to create a 3D Printer Robonomics Print Dashboard`

The Dashboard Alpha Version 0.1 contains 4 Buttons.

Button A called Connect to Printer.
Button B called Send File 
Button C called Print
Button D called getStartHash

This Dashboard should be available under the route /robonomics.

We are using an Iterative Approach and tackle one tiny issue after another.

The vision stays the same. 
You enter checkout and it prints. 
Data gets collected. 
Process starts. 
After print, NFT gets created.

In the end we have an unstoppable Production Line.
